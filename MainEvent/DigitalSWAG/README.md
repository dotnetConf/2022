# Digital SWAG for .NET Conf 2022

Our design team has put together some great wallpapers to celebrate .NET Conf and the release of .NET 7.  In this folder, you can find wallpapers for your phone, desktop, watch, and even Microsoft Teams!

We ALSO have a new "digital pet" .NET Bot available for you to add to Visual Studio Code and play with as you work with .NET 7. Shoutout to [Marc Duiker](https://twitter.com/marcduiker) for creating the animations for this Code Pet.  Check out the digital pet extension and enable 'Mod' the .NET Bot at: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tonybaloney.vscode-pets
