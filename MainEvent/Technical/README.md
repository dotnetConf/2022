### The Whirlwind Tour of Building .NET Apps in Azure

Matt Soucoup 

Building an app with .NET is one thing - but where does Azure come in? What Azure services do you need to use to scale your app up to keep it responsive? Make sure it&#x27;s resilient in the face of disaster (I mean extreme success)? And deploy it across the world so anybody can get at it super fast? There are a ton of Azure services out there that can help, but making sense of them all can be confusing. In this session learn to make the most of Azure to build scalable, robust, and resilient .NET web (and mobile!) apps with Azure.

### Extending apps to mobile and desktop with .NET MAUI and Oqtane

Shaun Walker 

In this session we are going to showcase the exciting Blazor Hybrid support which is included in .NET MAUI. Specifically we will focus on the BlazorWebView control that allows Razor components to be rendered into an embedded Web View, allowing them to run natively on mobile and desktop devices. In this rendering model, Razor components load and execute very quickly and have full access to the native capabilities of the device through the .NET platform. We will also explain how you can get the most out of your code assets by leveraging the exact same web UI components across mobile, desktop, and web. And rather than using a simple &quot;Hello World&quot; scenario, all of these concepts will all be demonstrated using a robust open source modular application framework developed exclusively for Blazor and .NET MAUI.

### MVVM is easier than ever before with Source Generators, .NET 7, and the MVVM Toolkit

Sergio Pedri 

A deep dive into the new features in the MVVM Toolkit included in the 8.1 release, specifically those powered by Roslyn source generators. This session will introduce the .NET Community Toolkit and the MVVM Toolkit, go through several new scenarios made possible by source generators, and showcase how they can make life easier for developers (by removing a lot of boilerplate they&#x27;d normally have to write manually). It will also outline the source generator architecture and explain how it works and interacts with the IDE. This new release of the MVVM Toolkit will especially be useful for new developers just getting started with MVVM, as it will make the setup necessary to write viewmodels, commands and properties much easier and more compact. The 8.1 release also offers extended support to customize attributes over generated properties, which is especially useful in scenarios such as managing application state through viewmodel serialization, and more. The talk will also include a small demo using .NET MAUI showing how to use the new source generators in practice to refactor a small MVVM application.

### From RESTful HTTP API to gRPC

Irina Scurtu 

With an increasing need for scalability and performance dictated by the modern web, it becomes harder and harder to choose an API paradigm for inter-service communication.&#xD;&#xA;While making RESTful HTTP API calls between services still works, why not use something that will do the job even better? Welcome gRPC!&#xD;&#xA;gRPC has been a first-class citizen in .NET for a while. It is contract-based, performant - with smaller response/request bodies, perfect for polyglot microservice-based environments.&#xD;&#xA;If we sprinkle some client-side load balancing and the ability to expose a gRPC service as a RESTful HTTP API we might have the perfect point-to-point communication mechanism for microservice architectures.&#xD;&#xA;In this session, we will see how we can transform point to point traditional HTTP API downstream calls, to gRPC calls to gain some performance and bandwidth improvements.&#xD;&#xA;

### Human-readable Razor views with ASP.NET 7 Tag Helpers

Dino Esposito 

In spite of its inherent ubiquity, over the years HTML has been pushed to achieve goals it was never designed for. Conceived as a document-oriented markup language, it ended up being ubiquitously used to lay out web pages and gained extra features along the way to make new emerging goals reachable. Indeed, it&#x27;s a &quot;catch-me-if-you-can&quot; kind of game where the goal of building compelling web pages is a fast moving target that HTML alone (with the bother of standards) can&#x27;t just hit. We need an app-specific (or just a a web-specific), HTML- and CSS-based new markup language. Web components are the teh W3C answer, tag helpers are the ASP.NET&#x27;s take. In this talk, we&#x27;ll see how to build server-side tag helpers (Bootstrap-friendly) with ASP.NET 7 to greatly simplify Razor views and pages and give them an unprecedented level of expressivity.

### Tips and tricks on platform-code implementation in .NET MAUI

Luis Beltran 

.NET MAUI allows developers to integrate native code to extend the look and feel of mobile applications. On the one hand, you can customize a cross-platform control (or create new views) with native look and feel using Handlers. On the other hand, you can write your own code to access platform-specific APIs.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In order to get the best of these capabilities, you must learn some concepts (handlers, property mappers, conditional compilation, multi-targetting) which can be overwhelming. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The goal of this session is to provide tips on how to simplify the implementation of platform-specific code in .NET MAUI by using interfaces and partial classes, of course, with a cool demo.

### Pushing C# to new places with NativeAOT

Kevin Gosse 

One of the key features of .NET 7 is NativeAOT: a tool that allows developers to compile .NET code into a native application. The main benefits are faster startup and reduced memory usage, but it also unlocks a wide range of new native interoperability scenarios that were difficult or even impossible before. In this session, we will unveil some of the magic behind native interop, and see how NativeAOT can help us pushing C# to places where it couldn&#x27;t be used before.

### Down the Oregon Trail with Functional C#

Simon Painter 

In 1971, three students from Minnesota thought they could liven up a history lecture by creating a computer game for the students to play, and after several days of work in HP Time Share BASIC, they came up with what turned out to be a significant milestone in the history of computer games - Oregon Trail.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Oregon Trail is often regarded as one of the first great computer games, as well as being the originator of a franchise that is still running to this day.  It was effectively also one of the first instances of both Shareware and a Commercial home release of(depending on the version).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;My interest though, isn&#x27;t just in historical computer games, it&#x27;s also .NET and Functional Programming.  I want to use this as a worked example of one of my passions - Functional Programming in C#!  The challenge I&#x27;ve set myself is to redevelop Oregon Trail into C# using the following restrictions:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Near 100% unit test coverage&#xD;&#xA;* No variables can change state once set&#xD;&#xA;* No statements (for, foreach, if, where, etc.) unless there literally is no way of avoiding them&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I&#x27;ll also be demonstrating a few of the tricks Functional Programming can offer, like Higher-order functions, functional flows with simple Monads and Tail Recursion.  There should also be a bit of retro computing fun, while we&#x27;re at it.

### Leverage the power of the GPU, DX12 and D2D1 with ease using ComputeSharp

Sergio Pedri 

GPU computing and rendering has always been extremely complex and out of reach for most C# developers, to the point most would not even try. ComputeSharp is a new open source, C# library that solves this by leveraging the power of Roslyn source generators, full C# projections for HLSL types and APIs, and higher level APIs to interact with DX12 and D2D1, to empower every C# developer to easily integrate GPU acceleration into their apps. This talk includes an introduction to the library (https://github.com/Sergio0694/ComputeSharp), a deep dive into its architecture and how source generators make all of this possible, extremely efficient at runtime and fully trimmable, and a demo of how to use ComputeSharp to write and run a DX12 compute shader and a D2D1 pixel shader from scratch in a UWP/WinUI 3 application, doing all from just C#!

### Using Durable Azure Functions in .NET 7

Niels Filter 

With .NET 7 durable functions will be available for Azure Functions running in isolated mode. I&#x27;ve found that many people I&#x27;ve chatted to aren&#x27;t aware of durable functions. They can drastically simplify implementations by coordinating various distributed functions and queues.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I&#x27;d love to be able to show some realistic use cases for using these, specifically using isolated functions (which will be available from .NET 7).

### .NET Configuration In Depth

Chris Ayers 

Working as a consultant, something I often saw was teams moving from .NET Framework to .NET Core and .NET 5/6. As they adopted these new versions, they kept similar patterns and libraries. The teams weren&#x27;t taking full advantage of the improvements in .NET. One of those areas is Configuration.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Configuration holds our secrets, connection strings, application settings, and other data. We have checked it in, stored it in a web.config and transformed it in a pipeline. Today there are a variety of ways to configure our applications securely.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This session will cover:&#xD;&#xA;Strongly typed configuration&#xD;&#xA;Configuration providers - JSON, XML, INI files; Environment variables; Command Line;Azure App Config; Key Vault&#xD;&#xA;Dependency Injection&#xD;&#xA;The Options Pattern

### Event Sourcing with Marten and Postgresql

Jeremy Miller 

Marten (https://martendb.io) is an open source library that enables .Net developers to use the rock solid Postgresql database as both a document database and event store. In this session I&#x27;ll show how Marten provides &quot;event sourcing in a box&quot; through its integrated support for capturing event streams, projecting &quot;read-side&quot; views of those same event streams, and full support for storing and querying the projected views. All with one library and database. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We&#x27;ll go beyond the basics of event sourcing into Marten&#x27;s unique abilities like live aggregation and &quot;inline&quot; projections when you need ACID compliance rather than eventual consistency. We&#x27;ll also look at how Marten helps you deal with concurrency issues during event sourcing. And lastly, because Marten is absolutely intended for real world development, we&#x27;ll work through common integration scenarios with messaging infrastructure and Marten&#x27;s place within a CQRS architecture as well.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;

### Machine learning models with ONNX and .NET

Henk Boelman Beatriz Stollnitz 

Most machine learning models are trained in Python using frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow. You might expect that an application that runs the trained model would need to have all those frameworks installed. But does it need to?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It does not! By converting your model to ONNX, you can run it in any supported language, including your .NET applications! ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange) is an open standard for machine learning interoperability. It enables tools to work together by allowing them to share models in a commonly understood format.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In this presentation we will show you how you can train a machine learning model using transfer learning in PyTorch, we&#x2019;ll convert the model to ONNX, and we&#x2019;ll use it in a .NET application.&#xD;&#xA;

### Performance benefits of .NET 7 for Web Applications

J&#xE9;r&#xF4;me Laban 

We are most excited about .NET WebAssembly Exceptions and Threading support in .NET 7, AND YOU SHOULD BE TOO! &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Enabling WebAssembly exceptions in your projects allows for your code to stay entirely in WebAssembly for exception handling, improving the performance as expensive JavaScript/Wasm boundaries crossing is avoided. Also, the generated code size is smaller. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In addition, Threading allows your Web Apps to perform expensive tasks off the UI thread and avoid freezing the UI. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Come see how our clients have been able to experience 30%&#x2B; performance increase compared to even the very fast .NET 6, and to see how even Microsoft uses Uno Platform to power Windows Community Toolkit Labs, all using C# and XAML on the web.
